## **Business Case**: Optimizing Predictive Model for Sales Forecasting
Background:
Our company, XYZ Retail, operates in the highly competitive retail industry, where accurate sales forecasting is crucial for efficient inventory management, resource allocation, and overall business planning. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to overstocking, stockouts, increased carrying costs, and missed revenue opportunities. To enhance our forecasting capabilities, we aim to develop a robust predictive model that can accurately predict future sales based on historical data and relevant predictor variables.

**Problem Statement:**
Currently, our sales forecasting process relies on traditional methods that often overlook the complex relationships between various factors influencing sales performance. We need to improve the accuracy and reliability of our forecasts by leveraging advanced statistical modeling techniques.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this initiative is to develop a predictive model using backward elimination, a technique that iteratively selects the most significant predictor variables while eliminating irrelevant ones. By doing so, we aim to optimize our predictive model's performance and enhance the accuracy of our sales forecasts.
